# Using LLMs Effectively in Software Development

This repository is a collection of guiding materials, playbooks, and examples on how to effectively leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in software development projects.

The primary goal is to provide developers with practical resources to enhance their workflowâ€”from project planning and architecture design to coding and quality assurance.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains the following documents:

1.  **[`20250825-efektif-prompt-yaratma.md`](./20250825-efektif-prompt-yaratma.md)**: A guide to effective prompt engineering (in Turkish).
2.  **[`20250825-LLM-playbook-for-projects.md`](./20250825-LLM-playbook-for-projects.md)**: A practical playbook for using LLMs in mobile app development.
3.  **[`20250825-developing-projects-with-ChatGPT.md`](./20250825-developing-projects-with-ChatGPT.md)**: A comprehensive guide on integrating ChatGPT into the software development lifecycle.

### 1. Effective Prompt Engineering (`20250825-efektif-prompt-yaratma.md`)

This document (in Turkish) provides fundamental guidelines for creating effective prompts to get the best possible results from LLMs.

Key takeaways include:
-   **Be Clear and Specific**: Provide as much detail as possible in your queries.
-   **Provide Context**: Share relevant code, error messages, or background information.
-   **Use Natural Language**: Write as if you were talking to a colleague.
-   **Specify the Output Format**: Ask for lists, tables, code blocks, or specific formats.
-   **Use a Persona**: Ask the LLM to act as a specific expert (e.g., a senior developer).
-   **Separate Instructions from Content**: Use delimiters to distinguish your instructions from the text to be processed.

### 2. LLM Playbook for Mobile App Projects (`20250825-LLM-playbook-for-projects.md`)

This is a comprehensive, hands-on playbook with copy-pasteable prompts for using LLMs throughout the entire lifecycle of a mobile app project. It uses a sample "AI Photo Finder" app as a running example.

The playbook covers:
-   **Project Scoping**: Creating a "Project Card" to maintain context.
-   **PRD and Vision**: Generating a first draft of the Product Requirements Document.
-   **Architecture and Tech Stack**: Defining a mobile-first architecture and selecting technologies.
-   **Data Modeling**: Designing database schemas and API contracts.
-   **Project Management**: Creating milestones, estimates, and risk registers.
-   **Engineering**: Scaffolding code for UI, background services, and on-device ML.
-   **Privacy and Security**: Creating checklists and performing threat modeling.
-   **QA and Evaluation**: Planning for performance, relevance, and UX testing.

### 3. Developing Software Projects with ChatGPT: A Comprehensive Guide (`20250825-developing-projects-with-ChatGPT.md`)

This manual-like guide provides a broad overview of how to integrate ChatGPT into various stages of the software development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment. It's a great resource for understanding the wide range of applications for LLMs in day-to-day development work.
